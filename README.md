# GetInternet

Welcome to Get Internet! This program will tell you if you are connected to the internet, and allow you to run searches if you are.

This program works with any search engine that uses the ?search= function, provided that just their name is before .com in the url (exceptions made for Yahoo and duckduckgo).

**Usage**
```shell
> python Internet.py -w [google/bing/yahoo/duckduckgo]
```

*To switch browsers*
```shell
> !browser yahoo
```

*To quit*
```shell
> !quit
```
